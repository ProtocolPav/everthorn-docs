# Introduction
 
Welcome to Everthorn internal docs. These are meant to be used by developers to understand
the different services and tools available to their disposal.

## How Do I Edit The Docs?

Very simply! On the side of each page, there is an **Edit** button. It will take you to the github repository
where the files are stored, and will take you to the exact page you are on. Available for editing!

You edit using **markdown**, a simple yet powerful tool. Then, you commit the changes and wait up to a minute
to allow them to update!

## Creating New Pages

You can create a new page by creating a new `.mdx` file under the correct folder. For example, creating 
a new page called `Users` in the `NexusCore API`, I would create the following file: `users.mdx` and start editing it
as I please.
