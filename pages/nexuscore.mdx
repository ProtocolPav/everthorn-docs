# NexusCore

The link between every service. NexusCore allows any service to seamlessly
access the **Database** and any files stored on it.

For example, if someone's balance gets updated on Discord via **thorny**,
then when somebody runs the `!bal` command on the **amethyst server** they
will see their updated balance.

Essentially, the entirety of the system is designed to work with the data
stored on the **Database**. One could say that the system *is* the database
and NexusCore is the access to the system.
