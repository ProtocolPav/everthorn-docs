# Projects API Docs

Projects have a unique ID as a string. This means that when you create a new project with a new name, that name becomes
its ID. Hence, you can't have two projects with the same/similar ID, and you can't change your ID without creating a new project.

## Getting and Creating Projects

### Create Project
> Route: `/v1/api/projects/`

> Method: `POST`

Creates a new project and returns it. The status will be 'pending' as default.
Returns a 404 if a project with this name already exists.

Request Body:
```json
{
  "name": "The Project's Name",
  "coordinates": [x, y, z],
  "lead_id": 50,
  "member_ids": [40, 44, 23],
  "description": "Not the content! This is the description that people write during their application"
}
```

### Get Status History

Content is stored as a history. You can see who
modified content and when. All project members are able to
modify the project content.
