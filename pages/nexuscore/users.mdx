# Users API Docs

You can fetch users in 3 different ways: via their **`ThornyID`**, `Gamertag` or `Discord ID`. The last two require
you to also know the Guild of the user, since what is really happening is it is finding the ThornyID of the user 
based on the Gamertag and Guild ID or Discord and Guild IDs.
