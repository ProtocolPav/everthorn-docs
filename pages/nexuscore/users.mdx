# Users API Docs

You can fetch users in 3 different ways: via their **`ThornyID`**, `Gamertag` or `Discord ID`. The last two require
you to also know the Guild of the user, since what is really happening is it is finding the ThornyID of the user 
based on the Gamertag and Guild ID or Discord and Guild IDs.

---

## `/v1/api/users/thorny-id/<thorny_id>`
> Method: `GET`

Returns the user object based on the ThornyID provided.

---

## `/v1/api/users/thorny-id/<thorny_id>`
> Method: `PUT`

Updates the user based on the object provided in the HTTP body. The body must be
the same format as the user object.

Example:
```
{
  levels: {
    xp: 4000
  }
}
```
This will update the user object to set the XP to 4000.

**NOTE that this will probably change to separate routes in the future as this is too tedious 
for users of the API to remember the structure of the object**
