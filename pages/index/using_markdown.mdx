# Using Markdown

I will outline some common use cases of markdown just so its easier
for us to write beautiful docs.

- For bold, italics it is the * operator, just like on discord
- For code terms, such as files, routes, or variables, surround the term with `
 - Example: `Variable`, `/path/to/something`
 
 
```python
print('hello world!')
```
For a code block like that, you surround the code with 3 ` symbols.
Right after the first triple symbol, you write the language, like `python`, `javascript`, `typescript`, etc.
Otherwise, leave blank to have a long code snippet!
